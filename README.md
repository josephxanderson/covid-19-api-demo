#  Node.JS API Demonstration － Novel Coronavirus Disease (2019)

This project is an example of how to build a basic API using Node.JS.

## Requirements
You must install `node`, the JavaScript engine, and `npm`, which is a utility that connects to the Node Package Manager registry.

## Prepare to serve it up
First you need to install the dependencies. In a shell (Terminal or Windows PowerShell), run the command: `npm install`

Okay cool ☺️ now we can serve up our site: `node index.js`

Now go to your browser and visit the local site: `localhost:8080`
